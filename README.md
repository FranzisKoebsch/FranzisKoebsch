## Hi there 👋
Using data to better understand our ecosystems and to make good decisions inland use and climate policy
I am a **Data Scientist** focused on understanding **ecosystem-atmosphere interactions**. 
My work centers on the quantification and modeling of **greenhouse gas fluxes** to mitigate climate change.
My current focus is harmonizing **Eddy Covariance processing and post-processing pipelines** within the peatland research community to ensure data intercomparability and reproducibility.

### 🔍 Research Interests
* **GHG Exchange:** Analyzing CO2 and Methane emission patterns in ecosystems (peatlands, forests, lake).
* **Eddy Covariance Workflow:** Managing the pipeline from high-frequency data collection to the processing and post-processing of continuous greenhouse gas records.
* **Data Standardization & Harmonization:** Developing (community) standards for flux data processing and post-processing to ensure intercomparability.
* **Data Fusion:** Integrating meteorological and remote sensing data to enhance and contextualize ecosystem flux datasets.
* **Climate Impact Assessment:** Utilizing Radiative Forcing Modeling for a detailed understanding of ecosystem climate effects.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Investigating ecosystem-atmosphere dynamics and emission patterns through advanced time series decomposition and analysis.
* **Phenocam Analysis:** Extracting phenological signals and vegetation indices from RGB image archives to track ecosystem seasonality.
* **Machine Learning:** Applying Random Forests and Neural Networks for the gap-filling and upscaling of greenhouse gas fluxes.
