## Hi there! 👋
I am using data to better understand how ecosystems work and to support informed decisions for land management and climate policy.

### 🔍 Research Interests
* **GHG Exchange:** Analyzing CO2 and Methane emission patterns in ecosystems (peatlands, forests, lakes).
* **Eddy Covariance Workflows:** Setting up pipelines from flux calculations to annual budgeting.
* **Data Standardization & Harmonization:** Developing standards for flux data processing and post-processing in the peatland research community.
* **Data Fusion:** Integrating meteorological and remote sensing data to enhance ecosystem flux datasets.
* **Climate Impact Assessment:** Utilizing Radiative Forcing Modeling for a detailed understanding of ecosystem climate effects.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Investigating ecosystem-atmosphere dynamics and emission patterns through time series decomposition and analysis.
* **Phenocam Analysis:** Extracting phenological signals from RGB image archives to track ecosystem seasonality.
* **Machine Learning:** Applying Random Forests and Neural Networks for flux gap-filling and upscaling.
